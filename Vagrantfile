  # All Vagrant configuration is done here. The most common configuration
  # options are documented and commented below. For a complete reference,
  # please see the online documentation at vagrantup.com.

  # Every Vagrant virtual environment requires a box to build off of.
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/bionic64"

  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 80, host: 8080
  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 8000, host: 8000
  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 3306, host: 8033

  # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
  # using a specific IP.
  # config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.33.10"

  # Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.
  # Bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on
  # your network.
  # config.vm.network :public_network

  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is
  # the path on the host to the actual folder. The second argument is
  # the path on the guest to mount the folder. And the optional third
  # argument is a set of non-required options.
  config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/weblabdeusto", :mount_options => ["dmode=777,fmode=666"]

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb, override|
    # Don't boot with headless mode
    # vb.gui = true

    override.vm.provision :shell, :inline => $provision_script

    # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM. For example to change memory:
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "1024"]

    # Customize CPU number
    # vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--cpus", $vm_cpus]

    # This setting makes it so that network access from inside the vagrant guest
    # is able to resolve DNS using the hosts VPN connection.
    # v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--natdnshostresolver1", "on"]
  end
